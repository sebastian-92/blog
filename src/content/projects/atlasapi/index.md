Right now, one of the big projects that I am working on is the atlasapi (used to be named peglegapi, but I changed that)
Api spec (will change) is available [here](https://pegleg.stoplight.io/docs/peglegapi)
## Project Goals
### Main Goal
- Complete, easy to use api to make playable online the largest number of games possible
### Short term things (complete over summer of 2025)
- [x] Basic, title based search api
- [x] All flash games from flashpoint (163,654+ games)
- [x] All ROMS from thepegleg (~10,000 games)
- [ ] All emulatorjs compatible roms 
- [ ] Games repos like 3kh0 Assets
- [ ] Games from [gn-math](https://gn-math.github.io) and similar sites
- [ ] Cors proxy
- [ ] Custom gitloaf
- [ ] Ultimate Game Stash (automatically updating)
### Long term things
- [ ] All html5 games from flashpoint (34,778+ games)
- [ ] Custom bare/wisp to make all games completely compatible
- [ ] Completely Proxied Everything  
- [ ] itch.io player & search integration (~530,000+ games) (probably 600,000+ by the time this is implemented
### Possibilities (dont count on it)
- [ ] Better Metadata

Once short term things are complete, and the api and client have their initial release, it will have at least 200,000 games.
Once all of this is complete, it will have ~750,000+ games, all with (near) complete compatibility, and all unblocked.
