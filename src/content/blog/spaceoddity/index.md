In case you couldn't tell, I really like this song by David Bowie.

The song captures the moment where an astronaut, looking back on the world, observes a moment of tranquility, not knowing that he has lost contact. Very Peak.

Also, the song is good musically, and I like David Bowie in general.

You should go give it a listen.
