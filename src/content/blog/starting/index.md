![Hello There Image](/hellothere.webp)

Hello there! If you didn't know already, I'm Cbass92. I decided to start a blog. 
I'm still deciding what to post on it.
### Things that I will maybe add here
- In depth explanations of some of my projects and things that I learned doing them
- Answers for obscure things that were way too hard to find on the internet
- Opinions probably
- Updates on future plans for projects
- Explanations on why exploits work
None of this stuff is 100% guarunteed to be added, so don't count on it.
### Inspiration to start a blog
I decided to start a blog because of [Echo's blog](https://blog.3kh0.net), which I thought was cool and a good idea and such.
### Why does it look like this? Why not old web themed like your main website?
This is just way convenienter, and nice looking and compatible. I can write in plain markdown, and it still looks cool.
I may eventually make my own astro theme, but I'm still learning how to do that.
Astro nano is pretty based though.
