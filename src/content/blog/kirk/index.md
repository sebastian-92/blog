Anywho, as you probably have heard, Charlie Kirk has been shot while deflecting questions about mass shootings. 

queen-suzu on tumblr put it really well
> He wasn't just "a conservative we disagreed with." He was a fascist organizer who built his career spreading racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, Islamophobia, xenophobia, and anti-immigrant hate, actively harming marginalized communities every single day.


...

> Where were your sympathy posts for the thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza, deaths Charlie Kirk celebrated and justified? Where's your compassion for the immigrants torn from their families by ICE, an institution Kirk defended? Where's your energy for the trans kids, the Muslims, the Black and brown communities he spent his career attacking?

" But it's suppressing free speech >:["

Charlie Kirk actively worked to to stop free speech with his organization turning point, , depriving them of their livelihoods.

He would not blink an eye if I were shot. He himself said that gun deaths are "the sacrifice we make for the second amendment".

I dislike violence. It is not a good thing. However, if it is the only way to stop hate and more violence, I do recognize the necessity. 

This killing was not necessary, and shoud not have happened, but it at least it happened to a bad guy, get smoked lmao.

One more good fascist.
