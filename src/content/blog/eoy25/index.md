As the 24-25 school year comes to a close, this post outlines the plans for thepegleg.

There will be less fixes and additions to the website as it is live right now, until one big update sometime during the summer.

### Things planned so far for the update
- wayyyy better UI
- Integrated Proxy
- A more streamlined Atlas, and an expansion of the library
- Probably other things

### Plans for other projects
- atlasapi
  - an api to serve and search unblocked games
  - very peak
- atlas v3
    - the companion to atlasapi 
    - this aims to be a user-customizable client to play games from sources pulled from standardized index files. Sort of like [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/)
      but for online gaming
    - also very peak <br>
