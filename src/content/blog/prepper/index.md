So, Trump got elected. I can't really see this ending up well.<br>
Anywho, I'm making an ssd of things to help to rebuild society or whatever just in case.<br>
Things I have on there:<br>
### ZIM files of a bunch of wikis<br>
ZIMs archived:
      - **Wikipedia** Good record of basic human knowledge<br>
      - **Wikiversity** Learning resources for all kinds of stuff<br>
      - **Ifixit** How to fix everything<br>
      - **Wikisource** Library<br>
      - **Wikitionary** Dictionary<br>
      - **The kiwix "prepper" hotspot** [full list here](https://preppers.demo.hotspot.kiwix.org/download/) 28 zims for preppers<br>
      - **The kiwix "medical" hotspot** [full list here](https://medical.demo.hotspot.kiwix.org/download/) 23 zims about health<br>
  #### Why?
Obvious reasons for each.

If you haven't gone down the rabbit hole of hosting a wikipedia mirror, a ZIM file is like a WARC file, a fill archive of a website, in a format able to be re hosted and still shown in the same manner, The program used to host these files is Kiwix, and they provide ZIMs of all the wikimedia wikis, and a bunch of other zims.<br>
### llamafiles<br>
I also have several llamafiles on there.<br>
llamafiles included:<br>
      - Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K<br>
      - Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.Q6_K<br>
      - lolzinventor_Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-SurviveV3-Q5_K_M<br>
#### Why?
 I included these so that we could have general purpose, easily usable AI access in the apocalypse, providing an easier way to access information.
      The survival model is extra important for obvious reasons.
- gnu/linux isos <br>
      - debian 32 & 64 bit<br>
      - puppy 32 & 64 bit<br>
      - rpiOS 32 & 64 bit<br>
Also executables to run all the things

I know this is not everything that would be needed, but it should definitely help.
I intend to continue expanding this drive.
